<p> Hi there! I'm Srikar, the creator of the North American Syncopa Awareness Society! (NASAS) The reason me and my team started this was so that we could spread awareness online. </p>
<h3> Beginnings </h3>
<p> We started the NASAS in July 1994, at the height of the Syncopa Scare. Similar to the AIDS epidemic of the 80s and late 90s, musicians from all over the world feared syncopa.
Back then, catching syncopa marked the end of your musical career, as treatments were not easily accesible. Syncopa started from a jazz club in France in 1981, but started to spread
across the world starting in 1993. As such, NASAS was founded to raise awareness and raise money for treatment research. </p>
<h3> Growth </h3>
<p> Our membersip increased dramatically. From July 1994 to December of thesame year, our membership increased from 5,000 to 500,000. By July 1995, a year from our founding, our organization
reached 1 million. We were able to promote research for syncopa, and in January 1996, a treatment for syncopa, which is the most common treatment today, was proven over 80% effective. Syncopa was 
no longer massively feared by many. </p>
<h3> Online </h3>
<p> In February 1996, we started this website (back when we had the .org domain ), to reach more people via the internet. </p>
<h3> Later Years </h3>
<p> From 1996-1998, our membership remained 1 million, noot growing or decreasing. Starting 1999, our membership declined, as syncopa became less of an issue in the music community. From 1999 to 2003,
our membership declined feom 1 million to 50,000. Also, we went from over 100 events a year in 1996, to only 5 in 2004. In 2005, with a membership of only 10,000, we officialy disbanded, and switched from a
.org domain to a .tk domain, a free one. Thank you for your patronage, and keep spreading awareness. </p>
<p> Sincerely, </p>
<p> Faculty of the North American Syncopa Awareness Society </p>
